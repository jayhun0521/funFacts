        <h2 className='center'>African Americans and Civil War 1861-1865</h2>
        <p>When Union troops invaded Confederate states, thousands of Black slaves flocked to Union camps for a chance to fight — and a chance for freedom. Many of these men were unofficially allowed to enlist in the Union Army. After President Abraham Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation, Jan. 1, 1863, Black Soldiers were officially allowed to participate in the war.<br/> Black Soldiers distinguished themselves in battle on numerous occasions. On Feb. 1, 1863, Col. T. W. Higginson, commander of the 1st Regiment South Carolina Volunteers (Union), gave this report after the St. Mary’s River expedition in Georgia and Florida — “No officer in this regiment now doubts that the key to the successful prosecution of this war lies in the unlimited employment of Black troops… It would have been madness to attempt [the battle], with the bravest white troops, what I have successfully accomplished with the Black ones.” <br/>Approximately 186,000 Black Soldiers — including 94,000 former slaves from Southern states — ultimately served in the Union Army and 38,000 were killed in action. <br/>The Confederate Army recruited a handful of Black Soldiers in March 1865, but they were still being organized when the war ended, and they never saw action.</p>
